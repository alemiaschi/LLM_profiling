This can demonstrate mastery of the subject by identifying connections between different experiments and explaining them using the same theoretical framework. She asserts that doing so would require developing hypotheses, selecting appropriate variables, and analyzing the results. However, she notes that it's crucial to consider the ethical implications of the research to avoid unintended harm to the human subjects. Although some participants might not appreciate being manipulated into having an ""aha ""moment, it is nevertheless a necessary component of the experiment. The methodological approach is the only one that can lead to discoveries with a profound impact"	6
